# Discrobble
"Scrobble" your current Google Play Music song title and artist to Discord.

## Setup
You have to install the userscript manually. Copy and paste the code in Discrobble.js into your browser's user script manager, and change the following two lines accordingly:

```js
var discordToken = ""; // your Discord token (see localStorage)
var streamURL = ""; // if you want to show as "streaming", set to a twitch URL
```

**Reminder**: this *technically* counts as a selfbot, which is "illegal". Use at your own risk.
